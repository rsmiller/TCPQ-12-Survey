# Backstory
I saw a Jordan Peterson video this morning and went down a rabbit hole that led me to the above-referenced article. There was almost nothing related to the TCPQ-12 when Googling. So, I generated this insanely rough Python webpage because I didn't have any paper and got a score of 68. I saw there was a Creative Commons, and with the score I got, I thought it to ironic not to be the first to throw some code into the ether given the subject matter and the F1 questions lol.

# Purpose
The purpose of this webapp is to give a visual representation of the test. It only displays the scores and the F1-F3 values. There is no insight given based on these scores. You can read the article, see the questions, and perform this scored calculation on paper; this is just the digital representation of that.

If you want insights for these scores, reach out to Julio C. Penagos-Corzo and Axel Saucedo and/or read the article and what it is trying to accomplish.

# Install
Get Python. Go to the folder and open a prompt:
```python
pip install flask
py TCPQ-12-Survey.py
```
Take test. Feels good man.
